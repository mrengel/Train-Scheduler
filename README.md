A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

- When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following: 
Train Name, 
Destination , First Train Time -- in military time, 
Frequency -- in minutes

- This app calculates when the next train will arrive; relative to the current time.

- Users from many different machines should be able to view same train times.
